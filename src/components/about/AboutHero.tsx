          Unimodul was born from a visionary idea: to transform the way we build to adapt to the needs of an ever-evolving world. Our founders, passionate about technological innovation and committed to sustainable development, identified a clear problem in the construction sector: inefficiency, high costs, and the environmental impact of traditional methods.

        <p className="text-lg">
          The spark that gave life to Unimodul emerged from observing the modular revolution in other sectors, such as technology and manufacturing, and how this approach could be applied to architecture. In 2022, with a multidisciplinary team of architects, engineers, and sustainability specialists, the Unimodul adventure began, with the goal of democratizing access to customizable, efficient, and sustainable housing.
